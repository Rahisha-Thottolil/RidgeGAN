# Prediction of Transportation Index for Urban Patterns in Small and Medium-sized Indian Cities using Hybrid RidgeGAN Model
In this study, we propose a hybrid model: RidgeGAN, to predict the transportation index (we refer as "road network density") for urban patterns in small and medium-sized Indian cities. Our study considers publicly available real-world cities database; human settlement datasets namely - World Urban Footprint (WUF,2019) and road Maps-Open Street Maps (OSM-2019) for the selected Indian cities. We establish a relationship between the transportation index and human settlement indicators and model it using Kernel Ridge Regression KRR.
